# Phonon_Isosurfaces

This repository contains all data and information necessary to generate both experimental and theoretical phonon isosurfaces

Work was done Fall 2024 as part of an ME490 independent study course with Professor Olivier Delaire at Duke University

Within the Full_Workflows/experimental/main.py and Full_Workflows/phonopy/main.py a full description and step by step guide to both workflows is given. Further information is provided throughout all code.
